Coffee businesses of a new caliber are popping up all over the world. Unfortunately, these businesses are often misunderstood. We don’t want to leave you in the dark, so we are going to expose what many don’t understand about this new wave of coffee.

Allow me to introduce you to the grand world of Specialty Coffee.

Older than average baristas, funny coffee farm names, latte art, manual coffee brewing, and tiny espresso drinks are the things we see in the specialty coffee movement, but the roots go much deeper.
